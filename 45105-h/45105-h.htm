<h2 class="sans">TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.</h2>

<p class="titleit">(By Mr. Punch's own Short Story-teller.)</p>

<p class="title1b">I.&mdash;THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS. (<span class="smcap">CONTINUED.</span>)</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the room, with his brave old back against
the wall, stood my dear father, his arms tightly bound to his sides,
and a cummerbund tied firmly over that mouth which had never, save in
moments of thoughtless, but pardonable anger, spoken any but words of
kindness to his son. In front of him was couched a huge man-eating
tiger&mdash;I recognised his hominivorous propensities at once by the
peculiar striping of his left shoulder, an infallible sign to a
sportsman's eye&mdash;licking his chops in joyous anticipation of the
unresisting feast which Providence had thus thrown in his way. I could
see the great red tongue darting out now on one side of his mouth, now
on the other, while his immense tail lashed the floor in dazzling
curves. This spectacle would have been sufficient to shake the nerves
of an ordinarily courageous man&mdash;but this was not all. On one side of
the gigantic cat lay coiled an immense python, of the deadliest kind,
and on the other one of the tallest and most powerful elephants I have
ever seen was squatting on its haunches, blinking at my poor father
with its wicked little eyes. I knew at once what had happened. My
father's only weakness was a fondness amounting to mania for conjuring
tricks of all kinds. The latest mail had brought us some English
papers containing descriptions of the Cabinet Trick of the
<span class="smcap">Davenport</span> Brothers, who were at that time
(this may help to fix the date, a point on which I have never cared
to trouble myself) astounding all London by their dexterity in untying
themselves from ropes lashed securely round them. As soon as he had
read the accounts my father determined that he would practise the
trick, and for a week past he had spent hours in our little room with
coils of rope wound round every part of his body in the effort, which
had hitherto proved vain, to release himself. Every day the heroic old
fellow, still panting from his intolerable exertions, had murmured "I
am all but undone," but never&mdash;if the expression may be pardoned&mdash;had
he been so near his utter undoing as he was at this awful moment. Of
course I knew what had happened. The dastardly Chamberlain, whose
discomfiture I have already narrated, must have got wind of my
father's daily practice, and, taking advantage of his state of
bondage, must have introduced into our room its present horrible
occupants. The room was not a large one, and the stairs leading to it
were steep, and I have never yet been able to explain to myself
satisfactorily by what masterpiece of diabolical ingenuity the
scoundrel was able to carry out his stratagem.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 220px;"><a href="images/049-1.png"><img src="images/049-1-220.png" width="220" height="184" alt="The inept snake-charmer charmed." /></a>
</div>

<p>However, this was no moment for discovering explanations. The
situation required instant action. Fortunately, my father's eyes were
unbandaged, and for the space of half-an-hour, as it afterwards turned
out, he had been able to control his zoological invaders by the mere
magnetism of his unwavering glance. One wink, however, was bound to
prove fatal, and I saw from the beads of perspiration standing upon
the old man's rugged forehead that he must be very near the limit of
his power of keeping both eyes open. If a drop of perspiration should
happen to roll into one of his eyes there could be, I knew, but one
end to the business.</p>

<p>As good luck would have it, the animals had not noticed my
entrance. I immediately decided what to do. Addressing my father
silently in the deaf and dumb language, of which I am a master, I
adjured him to stand firm for another moment or two. I could see
from the expression of trustful thankfulness, which stealing over his
face, robbed it of every vestige of anxiety, that he had understood my
appeal. Then creeping cautiously to a cupboard, I opened it without
the slightest noise and found, as I expected, a small coil of rope and
a dish of Sallûns, a very tasty kind of native cake. Taking two of
these, I tied one to each end of the rope, and threw it deftly so that
one cake dropped under the elephant's trunk, while the other, by a
stroke of good fortune, fell right into the wide open jaws of the
python. The slack, as I intended, alighted gently in a running noose
round the tiger's throat. What I anticipated happened. The snake,
without troubling itself to discover whence the gift had come,
swallowed the Sallûn with which fate had so unexpectedly provided it.
In doing so it pulled the dainty at the other end slightly away from
the mammoth, who, seeing it moving from him, lost no time in seizing
it with his trunk and placing it, as is the wont of these animals, in
his mouth. The rope was immediately pulled taut, and began to choke
the tiger. His roars were awful but unavailing. Neither elephant nor
python would release his hold, and in just seventy-four seconds&mdash;I
took the time by my stop-watch&mdash;the beautiful striped brute was a
corpse. This, however, was not all. So hard did the two living beasts
struggle in their fearful tug of war that the tiger's head gradually
became detached from his body and rolled away to my immoveable
father's feet. What would be the result of the contest? The agony of
watching was frightful. In my suspense I tried to breathe a prayer,
but at the time all I could remember was the fifth proposition of the
first book of Euclid, which I repeated twice over without a single
mistake. Meanwhile, the two combatants, as the Sallûns went further
and further down their throats and into their stomachs, approached
closer and closer to one another. At last only a yard, then a foot,
then six inches, then an inch separated them, until at last&mdash;Great
heaven! my hair, even as I write, stands on end with unutterable
horror&mdash;I saw the python open its enormous jaws to their fullest
extent and swallow, yes, literally swallow the trunk, the tusks, and
the vast head of the elephant. Slowly the immense pachyderm
disappeared. I heard his great bones crack and shiver as inch after
inch of him was remorselessly engulfed until, after three minutes and
fourteen seconds, all that visibly remained of him was a little tail,
which for a space waggled feebly out of the snake's mouth. Then this,
too, was still. Another gulp and it was gone, and all was over.</p>

<p>To dispatch the python in its distended condition was the work of a
moment. I at once released the old man who had been the delighted
spectator of my successful cunning. His joy, as may be imagined, was
great, but his pride in his son was even greater than his joy. I
exacted from him a promise (which, I regret to say, he broke only a
few days afterwards) never again to practise the Cabinet Trick. Then,
having rung the bell and ordered my servant to carry away the remains
of the three beasts, I proceeded to make my preparations for starting
without delay in quest of the Pink Hippopotamus.</p>

<ol>
<li>Only the Association game shall be permitted, with the following
modifications.</li>

<li>Matches shall under no circumstances be played between the months
of September and May.</li>

<li>The sides shall consist of any number of young ladies (not "new"),
good-looking, and well-dressed, to be captained by a good hostess.</li>

<li>These are not to run, walk, or scuffle about with, after, or away
from, any ball whatever, nor to tumble about under any pretence, nor
to perform any evolution which may be calculated to disarrange their
toilet.</li>

<li>The play shall be conducted by the umpires, who are to be of the
male sex.</li>

<li>There shall be eleven umpires on each side.</li>

<li>In all cases where possible, the match shall be settled without
resorting to brute force, or needless waste of time and breath, by
appealing immediately before "kick-off" to the arbitration of the
referee.</li>

<li>The referee shall be the most intelligent and elderly foreign
count whose services are obtainable, or, failing that, the least
athletic cabinet minister or archbishop in the neighbourhood.</li>

<li>The goals shall consist of two large marquees, in which the
respective captains, assisted by the other lady-members, shall preside
over afternoon tea and ices.</li>

<li>In the event of the ball travelling anywhere near the goals, or in
any way endangering the tea-things, the referee shall at once stop all
further play.</li>

<li>It shall be permissible, and, indeed, recommended, that any, or
all, the umpires shall leave the football alone at any stage of the
game, and attend to the lady-players, and no umpire shall be ruled
"off-side" for so doing.</li>

<li>No cry of "hands" or other invidious comment shall be raised when
any umpire is caught asking any lady-player for her hand, or else what
would be the blessed good of the club's existence?</li>

<li>As many "corners" as possible shall be allowed. These are to be in
shady parts of the field or in the marquees, and are to be used solely
for flirtation.</li>

<li>A "free kick" shall be given to any umpire who fools about after
the ball, when he ought to be in the marquee.</li>

<li>If there be insufficient space, the game may be omitted entirely,
and tea given in the nearest and best-laid-out private gardens, where
there are shrubberies and summer-houses; or the match may be
converted, in the event of doubtful weather, into a dance.</li>

<li>16. No match shall be declared "off" after the banns have been
read.</li>

<p>You will soon be all right if you take <i>my</i> advice!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Well, I hope so, I'm sure," said the Walrus to the Carpenter.</p>

<p>"Or else what is to become of our pleasant little picnics on the
sea-shore?" said the Carpenter to the Walrus.</p>

<div class="poem width18"><div class="stanza">
<p>The Walrus and the Carpenter</p>
<p class="i2">Were hovering round the bed;</p>
<p>They wept like anything to see</p>
<p class="i2">Each Oyster hang his head;</p>
<p>"If they go on like this," they cried,</p>
<p class="i2">"They'll very soon be dead!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Drat 'em!" grumbled Nurse Crab. "They've been taking a
<i>drain</i> too much, I feel <i>sewer</i>."</p>

<p>"You're another, <i>Mrs. Gamp</i>," murmured a Native, lifting his
head limply from his brown-sand bolster, and dropping it back again
with a disconsolate dab.</p>

<p>"If you make bad puns to 'em in their present low state I won't
answer for the consequences," said Dr. Lobster, pulling Nurse Crab's
shelly apron in professional remonstrance.</p>

<p>Nurse Crab squared her claws like Amazonian elbows, and rolled her
protuberant eyes scornfully.</p>

<p>"Feel their pulses," suggested the Carpenter.</p>

<p>"They haven't got any," snapped Dr. Lobster. "Besides my claws are
not suited for pulse-feeling."</p>

<p>"Make 'em put their tongues out," hinted the Walrus.</p>

<p>"Tongues?" sneered Dr. Lobster, derisively. "Don't you know that,
like <span class="smcap">Charles Reade's</span> nigger, oysters are
'darned anomalies,'&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width21"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Because they have beards without any chin,</p>
<p class="i2">And get out of bed to be tucked in.'"</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Old riddles are more painful than bad puns," protested the
bed-ridden bivalve. "Tucked in, indeed. Well, <i>I</i> shall never get
out of bed again, that's one thing," he continued, with a spitefully
triumphant look at the Walrus and the Carpenter.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>don't</i> say that!" said the Carpenter, tearfully.</p>

<div class="poem width18"><div class="stanza">
<p>The Artful Oyster looked at him,</p>

</div></div>

<p>"<i>Silence</i> in the sick-room, or I'll turn you all out of it,"
snapped Dr. Lobster, making his claws click like infuriated castanets
in the Walrus's ears.</p>

<div class="poem width24"><div class="stanza">
<p>As a duck in a thunderstorm, quite thunder-struck,</p>
<p>Each sixpenny bivalve looks "down on his luck."</p>
<p>Fancy six bob a dozen! You <i>ought</i> to be nice,</p>
<p>You dear little darlings, <i>most</i> dear&mdash;at the price!</p>
<p>What <i>have</i> you been doing to make yourself sick</p>
<p>Like a lot of slum-dwellers? Come, answer me quick!</p>
</div></div>

<p>"'Spect they're shamming," said Nurse Crab, crabbily.</p>

<p>"I'd like to poison the lot of you!" muttered the irascible
invalid.</p>

<p>"Just what you've been trying to do, you murderous mossels!"
retorted Nurse Crab.</p>

<p>"<i>Mussels?</i> No! Come now! we're not as bad as <i>they</i>
are," protested the better-class bivalve, indignantly.
"<i>Mussels</i>, indeed! Mussels are low things, cheap and nasty
shams, sold by costers at a penny a plateful, and eaten by the
ravenous rabble with black pepper <i>and their fingers</i>! Eugh!" The
superior mollusk's soul-shaking, upper-class, high-toned shudder shook
it into a sharp attack of syncope, from which it was with difficulty
that Dr. Lobster's ministrations rallied it.</p>

<p>"Call yourself a <i>nurse</i>?" said the Doctor to Mrs. Crab. "You
ought to be ashamed of yourself. How would <i>you</i> like to be
compared to a whelk or a winkle? You and your mussels! Consider the
gentleman's feelings!"</p>

<p>"I <i>didn't</i> say <i>mussels</i>&mdash;I said <i>mossels</i>,"
muttered Nurse Crab, sullenly.</p>

<div class="poem width24"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Well, well," quoth the Lobster. "You take my advice,</p>
<p>And I fancy we'll do without <span class="smcap">Huxley</span> or

<i>Shortly after</i>, Miss <span class="smcap">Mopsa Brovik</span>
<i>enters by the door; she carries a pink parasol and a rather portly
portfolio with a patent lock</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Mopsa</i> (<i>as she enters</i>). Good morning, my dear
<span class="smcap">Spreta</span>! (<i>Sees the bag.</i>) Why, you are
unpacking a travelling-bag on the drawing-room table! Then
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span> has actually come home?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Takes off her things.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>turns and nods with a teasing smile</i>). As if
you didn't <i>know!</i> When you have never been down in these parts
all the time he has been away! (<i>Unpacking a flannel vest and a
respirator.</i>) Yes. He turned up last night, quite unexpectedly.</p>

<p><i>Mopsa.</i> Then it was <i>that</i> that drew me out here! I felt
I <i>must</i>. My poor dear mother,
<span class="smcap">Kaia</span>,&mdash;she that was a Miss
<span class="smcap">Fosli</span>, you know,&mdash;was like that. She always
felt <i>she</i> must. It's heredity. Surely you can understand
<i>that?</i></p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>takes out a bottle of cough mixture, and closes
the bag with a snap</i>). I am not quite a fool, my dear. But really,
when you have such a firm admirer in Mr.
<span class="smcap">Blochdrähn</span>&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Mopsa.</i> He is such a mere bachelor. I never could feel really
attracted to any unmarried man. All that seems to me so utterly
unmaidenly. (<i>Changing the subject.</i>) How <i>is</i> dear
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>?</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> Dear <span class="smcap">Alfred</span> is tired, but
perfectly transfigured by his trip. He has never once been away from
me all these years. Only think!</p>

<p><i>Mopsa.</i> That would account for it certainly. And I really
think he deserved some little outing. (<i>With an outburst of
joy.</i>) Why, I shouldn't wonder if he has positively finished his
great big book while he has been away!</p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>with a half smile</i>). Shouldn't you? <i>I</i>
should. But he has not mentioned it&mdash;perhaps he was too tired. And he
has been trying to teach that miserable Little
<span class="smcap">Mopsëman</span> tricks ever since he came back. I
never <i>did</i> care about dogs myself, and really
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span> is so perfectly absurd about him.
Oh, here he is.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="smcap">Alfred Früyseck</span> <i>enters, followed by</i>
Little <span class="smcap">Mopsëman</span> <i>on his hind legs</i>.
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span> <i>is a weedy, thin-haired man of
about thirty-five (or thirty-six) with tinted spectacles and limp
side-whiskers</i>. <span class="smcap">Mopsëman</span> <i>wears a
military tunic and a shako very much over one eye, and is shouldering
a small toy musket. He is bandy-legged, with a broad black snout and
beautiful intelligent eyes. His tail is drooping and has lost all its
hair.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>beaming</i>). Just see what really wonderful
progress Little <span class="smcap">Mopsëman</span> has made already
with his drill. Why, my dearest <span class="smcap">Mopsa</span>!
(<i>Goes up and kisses her with marked pleasure.</i>) You have come
here the very morning after my return? Fancy <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mopsa</i> (<i>gazes fixedly at him</i>). I couldn't keep away.
You are looking quite splendid! And how have you got on with your
wonderful large book, <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>? I felt so
sure it would go so easily when once you had got away from dear
<span class="smcap">Spreta</span>.</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>shrugging his shoulders</i>). It
<i>did</i>&mdash;wonderfully easily. The truth is my thick fat book on
<i>Canine Idiosyncrasy</i>&mdash;h'm&mdash;has gone&mdash;entirely out of my head. I
have been trying thinking for a change. It's easier than writing.</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> Yes, <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, I can
understand that. And then, when you had never really got farther than
the title&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>smiling at her</i>). No farther than <i>that</i>.
Somehow, none of the <span class="smcap">Früysecks</span> ever
<i>do</i>. My family is a thing apart. And now I have determined to
devote my whole time to Little <span class="smcap">Mopsëman</span>. I
am going to foster all the noble germs in him, create a conscious
happiness in his mind. (<i>With enthusiasm.</i>) That is my true
vocation.</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> You shouldn't have dressed the poor dog up like
that. It does make him look so utterly ridiculous!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/052.png"><img src="images/052-400.png" width="400" height="461" alt="He backs out cringingly...." /></a>
  <p>"He backs out cringingly.... Mopsëman slips out after him."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>speaking lower and seriously</i>). Only in the
eyes of the Philistines who couldn't see any pathos in poor Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Solness</span> and her nine dolls. The truly
reverent have no sense whatever of the ridiculous. Still, it would
certainly be better in future to keep Little
<span class="smcap">Mopsëmann</span> indoors, because if the dogs in
the streets saw him in those clothes&mdash;(<i>clenching his
hands</i>)&mdash;and after he has had that unfortunate accident to his
tail, too!</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, I won't
<i>have</i> you bringing up that again! There's someone knocking.
Come in.</p>

<p><i>The Varmint-Bl&#333;k</i> (<i>enters softly and noiselessly.
He is a slouching, sinister figure, in a fur cap and a flowered
comforter. He has a large green gingham in one hand, and in the other
a bag which writhes unpleasantly</i>). Humbly beg pardon, your
worships, but you don't happen to feel in the humour to see how this
little wounded warrior here (<i>points to</i>
<span class="smcap">Mopsëman</span>) would polish off the lovely
little ratikins, do you?</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>with suppressed indignation</i>). We most
certainly do <i>not</i>. He is intended for higher things. Get out,
you have frightened him under the sofa.</p>

<p><i>The Varm.-B.</i> He'll come round right enough.... There, didn't
I <i>tell</i> you! See how he sniffs at my legs. It's wonderful what a
fancy dawgs <i>do</i> seem to take to me&mdash;follow me <i>anywhere</i>,
they will. (<i>With a chuckling laugh.</i>) Seems as if they'd
<i>got</i> to.</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> There is certainly no accounting&mdash;&mdash; And what
becomes of them when they do?</p>

<p><i>The Varm.-B.</i> (<i>with glittering eyes</i>). Oh,
<i>they</i>'re safe enough, the sweet little creatures, lady. I'm very
kind to 'em. And if I could only induce you to let your lovely
poodlekin tackle a dozen rats, which 'ud be a holiday to a game little
sportin' dawg like him&mdash;&mdash; <i>Not</i> this mornin'? then here's a
loving good-day to you all, and thank ye kindly for nothing.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>He backs out cringingly, as
</i> <span class="smcap">Spreta</span> <i>retires to the verandah,
fanning herself elegantly with her pocket-handkerchief</i>;
<span class="smcap">Mopsëman</span> <i>slips out after him, unnoticed
by all</i>. <span class="smcap">Alfred</span> <i>sees</i>
<span class="smcap">Mopsa's</span> <i>portfolio</i>.</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Mopsa</span>). And
have you positively lugged this thing all the way out here. Wasn't it
heavy?</p>

<p><i>Mopsa</i> (<i>nods</i>). It <i>had</i> to be. It contains all
the letters written to my poor dear Mother&mdash;by Master-builder
<span class="smcap">Solness</span>, you know. My Mother had such a
rich, beautiful past. I thought, <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, we
might look them through together quietly some evening, when
<span class="smcap">Spreta</span> is out of the way.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Looks attentively at him.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>uneasily, to himself</i>). Oh, my good gracious!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) It would certainly <i>have</i> to be some evening
when&mdash;&mdash; But on the whole, perhaps, I&mdash;I really almost think we had
better&mdash;&mdash; It isn't as if you were <i>really</i> my second cousin!</p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>re-entering from verandah</i>). Has that horrible
person with the rats gone? He has given me almost a kind of turn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span></p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> He is a sort of itinerant Trope, I suppose. Talking
of turns, did I tell you that I, too, have experienced a kind of
inward revolution away up there among the peaks?... I <i>have</i>.</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> Oh, heavens! <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, was
it the cookery at those high mountain hotels?</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>soothingly, patting her head</i>). Not
altogether&mdash;be very sure of <i>that</i>. But it is rather a long
story. I should recommend you to sit down. (<i>They sit down
expectantly.</i>) I will try to tell you. (<i>Gazing straight before
him.</i>) When I look back into the vague mists that enshroud my
earliest infancy, I seem almost to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>slaps him</i>). Oh, for goodness' sake,
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, do skip the introduction!</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>disappointed</i>). It was the most interesting
part! But the long and the short of it is that I have resolved to
renounce writing my wonderful work on <i>Canine Idiosyncracy</i>! I am
going to act it out instead&mdash;on Little
<span class="smcap">Mopsëman</span>. (<i>With shining eyes.</i>) I
intend to perfect the rich possibilities that lie hidden in that
rather unprepossessing poodle. <i>There!</i></p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>holding aloof from him</i>). And is that
<i>all?</i></p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> H'm, yes, <i>that</i>'s all. But you never
<i>did</i> properly appreciate poor Little
<span class="smcap">Mopsëman</span>!</p>

<p><i>Mopsa</i> (<i>pressing his hand</i>). She never did,
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>. But <i>I</i> do. And we will teach
him the loveliest new tricks together. (<i>Fixes her eyes on him.</i>)
Just you and I.</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, I won't have the
dog taught any tomfoolery. You shall not divide yourself up like that.
Do you hear?</p>

<p><i>Sanitary Engineer Blochdrähn</i> (<i>enters by door</i>). Aha,
so you've got your husband thoroughly in hand, as usual, eh, Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Früyseck</span>? (<i>To the others.</i>) I bring
glorious news. I have just been called in to see to the Schoolhouse
drains <i>again!</i> I only laid them last Autumn; but there seems to
be a leakage somewhere. Quite a big piece of new work, really!</p>

<p><i>Mopsa.</i> And you are beaming with joy over <i>that?</i></p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> I am indeed. And afterwards I have several
important drains to disconnect at the great new hotel in Christiania,
and the most tremendous scientific safeguards to grapple with and
overthrow. What a glorious thing it is to be a plumber and make a
little extra work for oneself in the world! Miss
<span class="smcap">Mopsa</span>, can I persuade you to take a little
turn in the garden? Do!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Offers his arm.</i></p>

<p><i>Mopsa</i> (<i>takes it</i>). Oh, I don't mind&mdash;provided you
don't talk either shop or sentiment.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>They go out together.</i></p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>looks after them</i>). What a pity it is that
<span class="smcap">Mopsa</span> can't take more to that Mr.
<span class="smcap">Blochdrähn</span>, <i>isn't</i> it,
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Looks searchingly at him.</i></p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>wriggles</i>). Oh&mdash;er&mdash;I don't know. For then we
should see so much less of her.</p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>vehemently</i>). Oh, come! So much the better!
(<i>Clutching him round the neck.</i>) I want you all to myself,
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>. I love you so much I could throttle
you. I've a good mind to, as it is!</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>choking</i>). You <i>are!</i> My loyal, proud,
true-hearted <span class="smcap">Spreta</span>, d-don't!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Gently releases himself.</i></p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> You have ceased to care for me. Don't deny it,
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Bursts into convulsive weeping.</i></p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> I will frankly admit that, like most married
Norwegians, I am&mdash;h'm&mdash;subject to the Law of Change.</p>

<p><i>Spreta</i> (<i>with increasing excitement</i>). I saw that so
plainly last night. I sent out for some champagne,
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, expressly for <i>you</i>. And you
didn't drink a drop of it!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Looks bitterly at him.</i></p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> I knew the brand. (<i>With a gesture of
repulsion.</i>) Gooseberry, my dear, gooseberry!</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> You never even kissed me, either. But you can kiss
<span class="smcap"><i>Mopsa!</i></span>
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, if you imagine <i>I</i> am the kind
of person to play gooseberry&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alfred.</i> Need dramatic dialogue descend to these sordid
details? Really this is verging on a mere vulgar row! And when you
know, too, how I have always regarded <span class="smcap">Mopsa</span>
almost as a sort of sister!</p>

<p><i>Spreta.</i> I know that sort of sister,
<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>. She comes from Norway! But I am
none of your fish-blooded Mrs. <span class="smcap">Solnesses</span>,
or half-witted <span class="smcap">Beata Rosmers</span>, and I'm not
going to <i>stand</i> it! I decline to share you with anything or
anybody&mdash;whether it's a thick fat book that never gets even begun, or
a designing minx that helps you in your precious "vocation," or a
gorging little mongrel, with his evil red and green eyes, that I'm
often tempted to wish at the bottom of the fiord!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Confused cries and barks are heard outside.</i></p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>shocked</i>). <span class="smcap">Spreta!</span>
When I am going to bring all his desires into harmony with his
digestion! <i>How</i> unkind of you! (<i>Looks out for a moment.</i>)
What in the world are all the dogs barking at down there?</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> (<i>re-entering with</i>
<span class="smcap">Mopsa</span>, <i>by glass door</i>). Only some
organ-grinder's monkey. They have just frightened it into the fiord.
<i>Such</i> fun!</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>in an agony of dread</i>). Can it be our
Little&mdash;&mdash;? But he is burying bones in the back garden. And he is not
a <i>monkey</i>, either. And if he were, monkeys can all swim.... What
are they saying now?... Hush!</p>

<p><i>San. Eng. Bloch.</i> (<i>leans over verandah railings</i>). They
say, "He is still shouldering the little musket!"</p>

<p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>almost paralysed</i>). The little&mdash;&mdash;it <i>is</i>
<span class="smcap">Mopsëman</span>! I taught him to do it so
thoroughly! (<i>With outstretched arms.</i>) He cannot shoulder a
musket and swim too! (<i>Glancing darkly at</i>
<span class="smcap">Spreta</span>.) Woman, you have your wish!
Henceforth my life will be one long rankle of remorse!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Sinks down in the armchair.</i></p>

<p><i>Mopsa</i> (<i>with an affectionate expression in her eyes</i>).
Not <i>alone</i>, <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>! We will rankle

<h2>THE BATTLE OF EVESHAM.</h2>

<p class="title">Who won it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The answer to this question
is simplicity itself&mdash;my League did it. We got the Labourers
Allotments and we gained our <i>quid pro quo</i> (this phrase has
kindly been supplied by a distinguished patron of ours) in votes. All
efforts to prove that <span class="smcap">Impey's</span> the friend,
not <span class="smcap">Long</span>, were in vain. But the credit that
it was not so is ours.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;From careful inquiries made
in London, I'm convinced that the principles underlying our League
resulted in Colonel <span class="smcap">Long's</span> return.
Englishmen are, after all, sportsmen; and Worcestershire is an
integral portion of England. If more proof is wanted, I need only
mention that only one day before the polling we received an
application from Evesham for the formation of a local branch.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">The Sec. of the Sportive
League.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;<i>We</i> did the trick. We
had five canvassers per man in the division, and during the contest we
paid 53,219 visits, leaving 2,159,549 leaflets. We've learnt our
tactics from organ-grinders who are paid to go into the next street.
Rather than keep us with them, the electors promise us their votes.
Next please!</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">The Secretary of the Irish
Ulsterical Brigade.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I believe some were foolish
enough to imagine that South Worcestershire men were going to abandon
their <span class="smcap">Collings</span> to follow Home Rule. But, as
I knew, it <i>could</i> not be, and it was not. The agricultural
labourer knows his friend when he sees him; and Colonel
<span class="smcap">Long</span> is M.P. to-day because of the
unceasing efforts of the Labourers' Friend,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">J-sse C-ll-ngs.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;It is very good of you to ask
me my opinion. I think that the Evesham contest ended in the way it
did because of (<i>a</i>) the Register, (<i>b</i>) the Floods,
(<i>c</i>) the Out Voters, and (<i>d</i>) the Independent Labour
Party. The connection with the last named may not be obvious. In point
of fact, it isn't. But, as a true Liberal, I feel bound to allege
it.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">The Man who did not Get
In.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I gladly find time to answer
the question,&mdash;"How did I win Evesham?" I won it because, whilst my
opponent got only 3,585 votes, I polled 4,760. As 3,585 is, even to
the naked eye, distinctly less than 4,760, I was declared elected. In
my humble judgment&mdash;though I freely admit that I am an interested
party&mdash;the Returning Officer took the only course that was open to
him.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Abbey Thought!</span>"&mdash;"<i>The Quest of the

Arthurian legend is attracting at the Lyceum. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Edwin A. Abbey</span> has been five years at work
upon this most striking series. Their beauties are many: their faults
very few, and when these are pointed out to the Anglo-American artist,
he gaily replies, "What's the odds as long as I'm Abbey!" Which is
true; as none but himself can be his parallel.</p>

<h3>A WILDE "IDEAL HUSBAND."</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oscar Wilde's</span> <i>Ideal Husband</i>,
at the Haymarket, is an interesting play up to the end of the Third
Act; and if this climax had been contrived more artistically, and less
conventionally, the situation at the fall of thecurtain in this act
would have been a very powerful one. As it is it is frittered away in
conventional dialogue, and the Fourth Act is decidedly weak. It is
throughout excellently played by Miss <span class="smcap">Julia
Neilson</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">Waller</span> in the two
principal characters. Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawtrey's</span>
performance, in spite of his curious habit of raising his voice to
such a pitch as to suggest his playing to the cab-rank outside, is
admirable. There are here and there sharp bits of dialogue in it,
though scarcely a line in the lighter vein that rises above farcical
comedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bishop's</span> <i>Earl of Caversham</i> is
a thoroughly natural piece of acting, and Mr.
<span class="smcap">Brookfield's</span> <i>Phipps</i>, the Butler, a
bit of character so perfectly rendered that, like <i>Sam Weller's</i>
Valentine, it makes you "wish as there was more in it." Miss
<span class="smcap">Fanny Brough</span>, having plenty to say, but not
much worth listening to, does her best with a poor part. Miss
<span class="smcap">Maude Millett</span> is nice, and Miss
<span class="smcap">Florence West</span> as unsympathetic as her part
was intended to be. That when <i>Sir Robert Chiltern</i> proposed to
retire from Parliamentary life no one suggested to him that he should
take "the Chiltern Hundreds" is evidently an oversight of the
author's, which no doubt he now deeply regrets. The play, though in
sharp dialogue not up to Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilde's</span> high
spirits-and-water mark, is an unmistakable success.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Odd, that the mercantile community does not even
now seem attracted to this Court. You are sure, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Redbagge</span>, that the inducements which we
offer to litigants are widely known?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Redbagge, Q.C.</i> The officer of the Court tells me, m'lud,
that he has sent round circulars to every mercantile establishment in
the City.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Our scale of commissions is surely generous
enough! By the new Rules of Court which I have made, a bonus of £500
is offered to any merchant who swears, on affidavit, that he was about
to resort to arbitration but decided to come here instead. Then I
think the plan of giving his head clerk one year's rent of his
dwelling and a free fortnight at Yarmouth for himself and his family,
as a reward for influencing his principal to resort to us, was rather
adroit&mdash;eh, Mr. <span class="smcap">Redbagge</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Redbagge, Q.C.</i> Excellent! And the boxes of chocolate to
his door-keeper, and free tickets to the music-halls for other
subordinate members of his establishment, <i>ought</i> to have brought
a plethora of business to this court.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Quite so. Not to mention the fact that we pay
counsel's and solicitor's fees out of public funds, instead of looking
to the litigants themselves to provide them. If <i>that</i> isn't
cheap justice, I should be glad to know what is.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Redbagge</i> (<i>deferentially</i>). And the mercantile
classes must surely be aware that no Judge on the Bench has a greater
knowledge of the law than your ludship.</p>

<p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>ignoring the flattery</i>). Unfortunately the
mercantile classes seem also to have a knowledge of the law, and not
to like what they know of it. So they resort to the ruinous&mdash;I repeat,
the thoroughly ruinous&mdash;practice of arbitration.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Redbagge.</i> It is really a serious state of things,
m'lud&mdash;for us, not for your ludship. "Those who live to plead, must
plead to live"&mdash;and it's a little difficult to plead
when&mdash;(<i>breaking down</i>)&mdash;there are no clients.</p>

<p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>soothingly</i>). We must think of some other
plan of attracting them, I suppose. How would it be if, instead of
troubling them to come here, the Court offered to go to their offices
and sit <i>there?</i> Or perhaps a few baronetcies scattered about
among them might have the desired effect. Well (<i>rising</i>) as
there are no cases on our list, and no prospect of any, the Court is
forced to adjourn!</p>

<p>Me and <span class="smcap">Brown</span>, and sum two or three of
our most intimet frends, has had a most liberal offer made to us, rite
in the werry art of Sent Pancras, to go out a canwassing for the
County Counsellers when the elections begins shortly.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 160px;"><a href="images/057-3.png"><img src="images/057-3-160.png" width="160" height="314" alt="County Councillor" /></a>
</div>

<p>I need scarcely say as they havent made much effect upon me, as I
knows em too well from what I hear about em at our own Gildall and
the Manshun House, but the terrems is suttenly werry liberal, both in
refreshments and in promisses, but they all depends upon their
suckcess, and from what I hears that aint likely to be werry great. Of
course in the grand old Citty that wont be not nothink, but ewen in
Sent Pancras I hears as it wont be any think werry grate. I've bin up
to their own Gildall at Charing Cross again, but they does make sitch
dredful long speeches that they quite tires me out, and they are all
about such dredful tiresome subjecs that I soon gits weary on em.</p>

<p>I was told down at Gildall that one of our most poplar aldermen had
quite made up his mind to try and turn out the Prime Minister, Lord
<span class="smcap">Roseberry</span>, I think his name is, from
representing a County Council, but there must have been sum mistake
sum where, for Prime Ministers aint exactly the sort of gents as is
ginerally selected to represent her most gracious Majesty the
<span class="smcap">Queen</span>, as I spose as the
<span class="smcap">Prime Minister</span> does, and to be a County
Counseller as well. No, no, them sort of things dont exacly go
together. Our Gildall peeple dont seem werry much alarmed about the
fuss has has been made about their Unyfecation, as I think they calls
it, which is supposed to mean that they are all to be turned out of
Gildall, and all London to be created into one great body of Common
Counselmen! And what is to become of all our numerous Aldermen and
Deppertys, and settera, not none of us knows a bit! But of course
that's all nothink but mere nonsence, that helps to keep our reel
gentlemen in good humer. They dont seem in werry bad sperrits, for sum
of the most importentest of em all had a grand meeting on Tuesday
last, and laid the werry fust stone of a butiful new Manshun, werry
close to Gildall, which I am told is to cost about thirty-five
thowsand pounds, and will take a hole year to bild, so that didn't
look as if they were quite fritened out of their wits; and just to
show the principle gents among em as there wasn't not nothink to fear,
the nobel Gent as took the chair inwited amost a hundred of em to dine
with him in the most scrumpsheous way possible, and drunk their helths
all round! There was only just about harf a dozen of County
Counsellers present, and they was just about as quiet as they
ginerally is when reel gents is with em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> tells me as how as he hears that
the Prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span> is most strongly oposed
to the Old Citty being interfered with, and that amost all the great
House of Lords agrees with him, so there aint much fear of much being
done, after all.</p>

<p>I suppose there is no one that has not wished, from Time to Time,
that someone else had lived in another Age than his own. I myself have
often felt that it would have been nice to live in 1894; to have seen
the "<i>Living Pictures</i>" at the old <i>Empire</i>, to have
strained my Eyes for a glimpse of <i>Mrs. Patrick Campbell</i>, broken
my Cane applauding <i>May Yohé</i>, and listened to the <i>Blue
Hungarians</i> while dining, on a Sunday, at that quaint old Tavern
<i>the Savoy</i>. At that time the Beauties from New York had not
quite lost their Vogue. <span class="smcap">Christopher
Columbus</span>, who discovered the United States, left it to the
Prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span> to invent their
inhabitants: personally, I am more implected with their Botany; and
am, indeed, at this moment, engaged in a study of the Trees in
America. Much of this remote Period must remain mobled in the Mists
of Antiquity, but we know that about then flourished the Sect that was
to win for itself the Title of the "<i>Decadents</i>." What exactly
this Title signified I suppose no two entomologists will agree. But we
may learn from the Caricatures of the day what the <i>Decadents</i>
were in outward semblance; from the Lampoons what was their mode of
life. Nightly they gathered at any of the Theatres where the plays of
Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilde</span> were being given. Nightly, the
stalls were fulfilled by Row upon Row of neatly-curled Fringes
surmounting Button-holes of monstrous size. The contrasts in the
social Condition of the time fascinate me. I used to know a boy whose
mother was actually present at the "first night" of <i>Charley's
Aunt</i>, and became enamoured of <i>Mr. Penley</i>. By such links is
one Age joined to another!</p>

<p>I should like to have been at a Private View of the "<i>New English
Art Club</i>." There was <i>Crotchet</i>, the young Author of the
<i>Mauve Camellia</i>; there were <i>Walter Sickert</i>, the veteran
R.A.; <i>George Moore</i>, the romanticist; <i>Charles Hawtrey</i>,
the tragedian, and many another good fellow. The period of 1894 must
have been delicious.</p>

<p>Perhaps in my Study I have fallen so deeply beneath the Spell of
the Age, that I have tended to underrate its unimportance. I fancy it
was a Sketch of a Lady with a Mask on, playing the piano in a
Cornfield, in a low dress, with two lighted Candles, and signed
"<i>Aubrey Weirdsley</i>," that first impelled me to research.</p>

<p>But to give an accurate account of the Period would need a far
less brilliant Pen than mine; and I look to <span class="smcap">Jerome
K. Jerome</span> and to Mr. <span class="smcap">Clement
Scott</span>.</p>

<p class="title">II.&mdash;TOORALOORA. <span class="smcap">A Fragment.</span></p>

<p class="titleit">(By Charing Cross.)</p>

<p>"My hair?" she said. "It touches the ground."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she seized her fringe by the roots and flung it on
the floor.</p>

<p>"A marvellous feat for a European," I murmured with some
difficulty. "Will you have another drink?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said <i>Tooraloora;</i> "I make it a rule always to get
intoxicated in a public-house."</p>

<p>I did not offer her a chair, I flung one at her head. That impulse
towards some physical demonstration, that craving for physical contact
which attacks us go suddenly with its terrific impulse, and chokes and
stifles us, ourselves, beneath it, blinding us to all except itself,
rushed upon <i>Tooraloora</i> then: and she landed me one in the eye.
Now, this was the moment I had been expecting and dreading,
practically, ever since her hand had left my ear the night
before&mdash;this moment when it should strike me again. I do not mean
consciously, but there are a million slight, vague, physical
experiences and sensations within us of which the mind remains almost
unconscious; and I have no pretensions to physical courage. For a
second I felt the colour rise to my face. Every expletive that should
have been forgotten, I remembered. My pulses seemed beating as they do
in fever, my ears seemed full of sounds, and I felt the cold touch of
the policeman's grasp like ice upon my shoulder as a voice murmured,
"This means forty shillings or a month."... When we reached the
station I flung myself upon the floor, leaning my head upon my hand,
the white powder upon my coat still lingered. I seemed to hear
<i>Tooraloora</i> murmur, "'E don't know where 'E are!"</p>

<h2>AT THE OLD MASTERS.</h2>

<p>The following selections may assist the Art-student visiting
Burlington House:&mdash;</p>

<p>No. 3. By <span class="smcap">George Romney</span>. Not so much a
"Rum Knee" as a queer left arm. Gout apparently, skilfully
depicted.</p>

<p>No. 5. By Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Raeburn, R.A.</span>
<i>Lorenzo and Jessica</i>, at 50 and 40 respectively.</p>

Selected from <i>Reynolds' Miscellany</i>. Portrait of a gentleman in
full uniform, out for a walk, on a stormy day, on the sea-shore. He is
evidently saying, "Here's a nice predicament! I've powder on my hair,
no hat, and it's coming on to pour cats and dogs."</p>

<p>No. 13. By Sir <span class="smcap">Joshua Reynolds</span>. A
Portrait of <i>The Marquis of Granby</i>. Presented, of course, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Weller</span>, Senior. Probably the original sign
of the inn of which Mr. W. was proprietor.</p>

<p>No. 16. By <span class="smcap">George Romney</span>. <i>Portrait of
Mrs. Farrer</i>. Charming. Might go Farrer and fare worse.</p>

<i>Portrait of Lady Hamilton.</i> "Unfinished"&mdash;but perfect.</p>

<p>No. 38. "A Constable"&mdash;who arrests our attention. This, you may
depend upon it, is a Constable <i>with a warrant</i>.</p>

<p>No. 50. By <span class="smcap">Rembrant</span>. Man guarding a
hawk. Very graceful, but a Hawk-ward sort of person.</p>

<p>No. 51. By <span class="smcap">Gerard Terburg</span>. A lady, after
taking something which has disagreed with her. "Prithee, why so
pale?"</p>

<p>No. 68. By <span class="smcap">Van der Helst</span>. It is called a
"<i>Family Group</i>,"&mdash;probably in consequence of the wife being
shown as presenting her husband <i>with a hare</i>.</p>

<p>No. 73. By <span class="smcap">Dick Hals</span>. Regard the
wondrous collars. It is "Collar Day." Must have been the work of two
artists, as this could have been painted by no one
<span class="smcap">Hals</span>(!!)</p>

<p>No. 94. By Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Laurence, P.R.A.</span>
"<i>The bells are a ringing for Sarah.</i>" Curtain rises and
<span class="smcap">Sarah</span> steps forward to sing.</p>

<p>No. 122. By <span class="smcap">Jacob Jordaens</span>. Splendid.
"Try our stout, <span class="smcap">Jane</span>!"</p>

<p>No. 126. By <span class="smcap">J. M. W. Turner, R.A.</span>
"<i>Snowstorm.</i>" Wonderful!! But where was the artist when he
took it?</p>

<p>Do not leave without closely examining No. 181, by
<span class="smcap">François Clouet</span>, "<i>Portrait of a
Princess</i>." And do not neglect the "gems of the collection" in the
Water-colour Room. This is full of "interesting and remarkable cases"
which have been fully reported in all the papers. The exhibition is
open till March 16. Don't miss it.</p>

<h2>A FEELING PROTEST.</h2>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I have recently seen letters and paragraphs in various
newspapers instigating travellers going abroad to choose the
Folkestone and Boulogne route instead of going <i>viâ</i> Dover and
Calais. I forget what particular reasons are given for advocating this
substitution, nor do I care what they are or what they may be. Why?
Because, first, undeniably <i>viâ</i> Dover to Calais is the shortest
route, and to those of <span class="smcap">Britannias's</span> sons
and daughters&mdash;gallant islanders all&mdash;who detest the sea as much as
does the humble individual who now addresses you, the saving of twenty
minutes or half an hour, or in some instances it may be even more, of
the sea-passage would be well worth any extra expense (if extra
expense there be, which, an' I remember rightly, is not the case),
especially when aboard such steam-vessels as are now provided; though,
be the steam-vessels what they may, there is still in one and all of
them that peculiar flavour and motion about which I would rather not
speak, or even think, lest I should be unable to finish this important
letter.</p>

<p>But there is yet another reason why the Dover and Calais route is
the best of all ways to the Continent, and that is on account of the
excellent <i>déjeuner</i>&mdash;still, as I believe, unequalled at any port
or at any station in Europe&mdash;served to the many poor hungry and
thirsty travellers quickly, hotly, and as comfortably as the
confounded bustling circumstances of travel will permit. Why the
railway company which takes us to Paris cannot give us three quarters
of an hour for our very necessary toilette (after the sea passage) and
our food, and then do the journey in double quick time, or in the same
time as now for the matter of that (for what does it matter to the
accomplished traveller who "<i>does</i> know where he are" and where
he <i>will</i> be, and has pre-ordered everything wisely and well?),
and so get up to Paris in time for a little late supper and an early
bed?</p>

<p>For those who value their digestions, and who love good food and
drink, even when they have but a short time for refreshment, there is
but one route to Paris from London, and that is <i>viâ</i> Calais,
<i>i.e.</i> <i>viâ</i> the buffet. Only, <i>cher messieurs les
directeurs de la ligne du Nord</i>, cannot you possibly manage to
extend our luncheon-time at Calais to just three quarters of an hour,
instead of giving us only a beggarly twenty-five minutes at best, and
do the thing well while you are about it? As to the Boulogne route,
well, one goes to Boulogne to stay, and so the buffet, <i>en
passant</i>, is of small importance.</p>

<p>May this reach the eyes and touch the hearts of all in authority,
for it is a <i>cri du cour</i> from</p>

  <p>In the Baron's Good Books.</p>
</div>

<p>Delightful reminiscences are these of <span class="smcap">George
Augustus Sala's</span>, told in his own peculiar rattling-off,
running-on, one-anecdote-down-t'other-come-on style. Of all "people he
has met" he has plenty to say, but <i>nil nisi bonum</i>; all writ
with a magnum-bonum pen. Once he was a "Gipsy King, ha! ha!" but, long
ago, as he tells us, he renounced all claims to the throne of Bohemia,
abdicated, retired, and, no more a Rad, has led a Reformed Club life.
Who wrote the burlesque Eugene Aram verses, ending with,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"And <span class="smcap">George Augustus</span> walked before,<br />
With gyves upon his wrist"?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the notabilities of his earlier days were mentioned in that
poem, at least so I believe, for does it not belong to a date when the
Baron had not come within measurable distance of his title when he
watched the great guns from afar with awe; when he saw them in the
Cyder Cellars and at Evans's, both of which night resorts he, having
been first taken there by a kindly but injudicious man-about-town,
subsequently patronised on such holidays as were offered to him by the
jovial nights after the Eton and Harrow matches at Lord's, and on the
eve of such a festival as the University Boat Race. The Baron in those
happy days and nights was attired in the costume in which
<span class="smcap">Richard Doyle</span> has dressed young <i>Clive
Newcome</i> when he accompanied his father, the Colonel, on that ever
memorable evening to The Cave of Harmony, and heard the song that made
him so wrathful. There are no Cyder Cellars, Coal Holes, and Evans's
nowadays, which owlish resorts were strictly restricted to the use of
the male sex, young and old. But even if a kind, considerate
legislature does insist on extinguishing the lights, and turning us
out in the streets at 12.30 precisely, are morality and health so very
much benefited by the process? Isn't it cheerful to read of the
pleasantly convivial late hours in the Georgian Augustan Era? The
celebrities at home and abroad that he knew were legion, and I'll be
bound (as the Book said) that he hasn't emptied his memory stores by
many a cupboard full. There is one sentiment which appeals to the
Baron's head, heart, and pocket, and delighteth him hugely&mdash;it is
<span class="smcap">George Augustus's</span> righteous denunciation of
"the unjust and iniquitous income-tax." The Baron says ditto to Mr G.
A. S. at p. 310, vol. ii. <i>Inter alia</i>, the autobiographist is
correct in saying that <span class="smcap">Madison Morton's</span>
<i>Box and Cox</i> was concocted from <i>Une Chambre à Deux Lits</i>
"and another French farce," of which, as he doesn't give the name, the
Baron will here take the liberty of mentioning it. It was a farce with
music, that is to say a <i>comédie-vaudeville en un acte</i>, written
by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Labiche</span> and
<span class="smcap">Lefranc</span>, and produced at the Palais-Royal
in 1846. Its name was <i>Frisette</i>. <i>Box and Cox</i> was produced
in 1847 at the Lyceum. Very little furniture for the English farce was
taken from <i>Une Chambre à Deux Lits</i>, but packages of dialogue
were handed in to <i>Box and Cox</i> from <i>Frisette</i>.</p>

<h2>QUEER QUERIES.</h2>

<p class="title">Costly Colours.</p>

<p>Could some reader inform me whether it would be of any use to
request the Works Committee of the London County Council to paint my
back door for me? It has become a little discoloured through age, and
a local carpenter has offered to put on "two coats of good sage-green
enamel paint" for five-and-sixpence. But as I see that the Works
Committee only spent £2,186 over the painting of Hammersmith Bridge, I
fancy that it would be cheaper to employ them, if I could. It is
pleasant to think what exceptionally fair wages they must have paid
over this job (using the word in its natural meaning), and how much
time the poor men engaged in it must have been able to give to their
family circles. This is as it should be.</p>

<p>They say the sham ice here is almost perfect, very nearly as good
as the real ice, in fact so little is the difference between the real
and sham that a skater, unless he had tried it, would hardly real-ice
it! The band plays, "Hwfa (Williams) of thee I'm fondly dreaming!" as
the <i>patineurs</i> and <i>patineuses</i> who have paid their three
or five shillings glide about at the rate of either eighteenpence or
two-and-sixpence a foot.</p>
